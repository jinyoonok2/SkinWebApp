"Risk: High. Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that develops from melanocytes, the cells that give skin its color. It's melanocytic and more dangerous than many other skin lesions because it has a high potential to spread to other parts of the body (metastasize) if not detected early. Characteristics include changes in size, shape, or color of a mole or other skin lesion, the appearance of a new growth on the skin, or a sore that doesn't heal.",
"Risk: Low to Moderate. Melanocytic nevi, commonly known as moles, are benign (non-cancerous) growths that arise from melanocytes. They're melanocytic and usually harmless but can sometimes develop into melanoma. Characteristics include uniform color, smooth borders, and a symmetrical shape, though changes in these features can signal a risk of melanoma.",
"Risk: Low. A nevus is a general term for a mole or other skin growth that develops from melanocytes or other skin cells. It's melanocytic when referring to moles specifically. Most nevi are benign and characterized by a well-defined shape, uniform color, and a stable appearance over time.",
"Risk: Low to Moderate. Basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer, arising from the basal cells in the epidermis. It's non-melanocytic and generally considered less dangerous because it grows slowly and rarely spreads. However, it can cause significant local damage if not treated. Characteristics include a pearly or waxy bump, a flat flesh-colored or brown scar-like lesion, and bleeding or scabbing.",
"Risk: Low. Actinic keratosis is a rough, scaly patch on the skin caused by years of sun exposure. It's considered pre-cancerous as it can lead to squamous cell carcinoma. Non-melanocytic. Characteristics include a rough, scaly patch on sun-exposed areas, potentially developing into a hard, wart-like surface.",
"Risk: Very Low. Benign keratosis-like lesions, including seborrheic keratoses, are common non-cancerous skin growths. Non-melanocytic. They're usually brown, black, or light tan, and have a waxy, scaly, slightly elevated appearance. They're not harmful, but their appearance can be similar to skin cancers.",
"Risk: Very Low. Dermatofibroma is a benign skin lesion that's more common in adults. Non-melanocytic. It's a small, firm, raised nodule that's usually brownish-red and may change color over time. Dermatofibromas are generally harmless but can be removed if painful or for cosmetic reasons.",
"Risk: Variable. Vascular lesions are a broad category that includes benign lesions like hemangiomas to more serious conditions like vascular malformations. Non-melanocytic. Their risk and characteristics vary widely, but they're generally marked by an abnormal growth of blood vessels in the skin or internal organs.",
"Risk: Moderate to High. Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that arises from squamous cells, which make up the middle and outer layers of the skin. Non-melanocytic. It's more likely to spread than basal cell carcinoma but less likely than melanoma. Characteristics include a firm, red nodule, or a flat lesion with a scaly, crusted surface.",
